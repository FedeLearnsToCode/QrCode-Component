## My process

I used Flexbox on the body element to center the card both vertically and horizontally. I set the image to width: 100% so it scales properly within its container. Finally, I defined the spacing (padding and margins) and applied the project's color scheme using CSS variables.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Css Variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I strengthened my core understanding of HTML and CSS, especially in creating clean layouts and writing maintainable styles.
